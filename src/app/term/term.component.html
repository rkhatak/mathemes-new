        <p><u>Online Ordering and Reservations.</u> Through the Site, you may order from (for pick-up and/or delivery (if available)) and make reservations at this restaurant (&#8220;Restaurant&#8221;). Both &#8220;Registered Users&#8221; and &#8220;Unregistered Users&#8221; (as defined below) may place an online order or make a reservation on the Site. Our ordering and reservation system is run by our service provider, Munch Ado, Inc. (&#8220;Munch Ado&#8221;). The terms herein only apply to orders placed (and reservations made) through this Site; the terms do not apply, for example, if you ordered from a different website. Prices for menu items ordered online will be identified as you place your order, and minimum order amounts may apply. Any applicable delivery fees, taxes, cancellation fees and other amounts due in connection with your order will be identified at the time you place your order. There may be limits on the dollar values, number of orders, delivery areas, number of reservations and size of reserving party which may be placed/made on this Site. For online orders, you are responsible for payment in full of your order by credit card (or other payment option made available on this Site such as Pay Pal) at the time of ordering, and no orders will be processed or fulfilled unless payment in full has been made in advance.
